- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass validation.
- The spec contains no [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers — the user provided
  exhaustive detail covering all sections, content, addresses, hours, and
  technical constraints.
- Assumptions are documented for: hero placeholder image, legal notice links,
  Google Maps embed fallback, phone international format, and cookie consent.
- Address discrepancy noted: the constitution references "10 Rue de la Mairie"
  while the user's latest input specifies "53 Avenue Jean Jaures, 95330 Domont".
  The spec uses the user's latest input as authoritative.
